AccuRates is a currency conversion API for developers building user-facing products that handle multi-currency amounts programmatically.

It’s designed for apps where exchange rates directly affect pricing, balances, or user trust, not for accounting, reporting, or finance-owned rate systems.

AccuRates delivers globally sourced Forex data refreshed every 60 seconds, with support for live rates, historical datasets, time-series analytics, bulk conversions, and multi-currency matrices, all through simple REST endpoints optimized for production use.

If your product needs consistent, up-to-date exchange rates inside its core logic, without requiring a dedicated finance team, AccuRates is built for that use case.
